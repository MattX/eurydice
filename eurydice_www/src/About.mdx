This is a reimplementation of the [AnyDice](https://anydice.com) DSL, which was created by
[Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/jasper-flick/). It runs in your browser, as you type.
**This project is not affiliated with AnyDice.**

You can run a short tutorial in the main page, or you can read the [AnyDice documentation](https://anydice.com/docs/);
Eurydice aims for very high compatibility. You can also read the
[Eurydice spec](https://github.com/MattX/eurydice/blob/main/spec.md), which is more technical.

## Why use Eurydice?

- A more modern development experience, with live results, better error reporting options, and a
  [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor.
- Faster: some operations use the [IcePool](https://pypi.org/project/icepool/) algorithm,
  resulting in a large speedup compared to AnyDice. I've observed typically faster compute times even
  in other cases, but YMMV!
- No compute timeout (but you provide the CPU!)

## Why not use Eurydice?

- You want more advanced output options.
- You're on a low power device and would rather do server-side computation.
- You don't like JS single page apps, or want to send requests through something other than a web browser.
